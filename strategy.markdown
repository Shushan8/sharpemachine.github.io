SharpeMachine system is completely automatic trading strategy with careful design to harness weak signals in the equity markets spanning over the decades of financial data. The system tries to capture the best performing factors over different market regimes and build a diversified portfolio taking into account the uncertainty of the future regimes and best performing equity factors. 

In addition, dynamic risk management system which adjusts the risk level given the shocks in the market is limiting the downside, while the focus only on highly liquid, well capitalized stocks limits the liquidity risk. 

The strategy has long and short positions that limits the exposure to the pure equity factor, but adds complexity managing short sales. However the improvement in risk profile is more than justified. In case the client is limited to use long only options, we provide long only solutions with less risk than the passive investments in the market indices. 

The system opens simultaneosly positions in 150-350 individual securities and no more than 3% of the original capital is invested in any of the stock. Therefore, any risk with individual stock is very limited and is not affecting the portfolio performance materially.
